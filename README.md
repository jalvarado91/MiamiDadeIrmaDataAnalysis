# Miami-Dade County Irma impact data analysis

This repo houses a jypiter notebook with some data analysis on the open 311 Service Requests data set made available by Miami-Date county over at [their open data portal.](https://opendata.miamidade.gov/311/311-Service-Requests-Miami-Dade-County/dj6j-qg5t) 

Currently the analysis outlines the changes on service requests by the community a week before and after hurricane Irma. The underlying work, however, can be expanded to cover timespans centered around other storms and hurricanes as well as other natural disasters. The data provided by the county goes back to 2013, so there's plenty to work with. 

Potential applications can include request load prediction and categorization in order to property anticipate and route service calls during critical times.
